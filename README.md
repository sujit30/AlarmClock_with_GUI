# AlarmClock_with_GUI
It is a simple project for alarm clock along with GUI.
All you need is 3 libraries - datetime, tkinter and playsound(You can also use winsound).
What I did was just took the data(time to wake up) from the user using tkinter and used it in While true loop which compared the user input values to the hour and minute obtained from the datetime library.
It's that simple!!!
